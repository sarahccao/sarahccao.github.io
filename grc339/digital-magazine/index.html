                  <p>Emerald Fennell knows a beautiful thing when she sees it. For Vanity Fair’s Notes on a Scene series, the Saltburn director does a deep dive on constructing the pivotal scene in which Oliver (Barry Keoghan) first arrives at the titular British estate and is taken on a tour of the lavish grounds by Felix (Jacob Elordi) before they spend a fateful summer together.</p>

                  <p>Although women make up half of all film school graduates, the best director Oscar has nominated only nine women in the awards’ history, with just three women claiming the honor: Kathryn Bigelow for “The Hurt Locker,” Chloé Zhao for "Nomadland," and Jane Campion for “The Power of the Dog.”</p>

                  <p>Watching Lulu Wang’s The Farewell caused in me a perceptual shift, a small yet sudden adjustment to how I pay attention to things. The effect lingers on after the film ends, as if it has a half-life.</p>

                  <p>Barbie will surpass $1 billion worldwide, according to Warner Bros. estimates. Hard as it may be to believe, that makes director Greta Gerwig the only woman in the billion-dollar club with sole credit for directing a film.</p>

                  <p>Director Mary Harron’s film American Psycho (2000) was a sensation when it was first released. It was a financial success, received mostly positive reviews, and gained notoriety for how it depicted the violent sensibility of author Bret Easton Ellis’s infamous novel.</p>

                  <p>There's been plenty of female-focused films this year: Barbie saved the day; Ariel was a sweetheart. It's rarer to see a movie about women who kinda suck. But there's a new film out where the protagonists are nothing but messy.</p>
